<strong>Some historical writings, Christopher Thomas Ryan</strong> <br><br>

This website will contain work from three projects.<br><br>

(I) An <a href="annotated-bibliography.html">annotated biography</a> of article-length "thought pieces" from (arguably) the four most important journals in development of operations research: Operations Research, Management Science, Interfaces, and the Journal of Operational Research Society. By "thought pieces", I mean articles that were not the usual "research paper" many of us are familiar with in OR, but instead offer perpectives, opinions, and experiences that pertain to the development of Operations Reseach. 
<br><br>
I will provide references with links to the articles and offer my own personal exploration of the content of that article. These explorations will attempt to summarize, but also raise questions or areas of further exploration that inspired me when I read the article.<br><br> 

(II) <a href="book-reviews.html">Reviews of books</a> that pertain to the history and philosophy of Operations Rearch.<br><br>

(III) A <a href="essay-collection.html">collection of essays</a> on my personal journey to understand my relationship to the field of Operations Research. These essays will also touch on anectdotes from the history of Operations Research from its origins until roughly the present day.<br><br>
