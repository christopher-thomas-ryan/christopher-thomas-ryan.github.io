I'm an associate professor in the Operations and Logistics division in the <a href="http://www.sauder.ubc.ca"> UBC Sauder School of Business</a> at the <a href="http://www.ubc.ca">University of British Columbia</a>. I obtained my PhD in Management Science at the <a href="http://www.sauder.ubc.ca">UBC Sauder School of Business</a>, advised by <a href="http://www.sauder.ubc.ca/Faculty/People/Faculty_Members/Queyranne_Maurice">Maurice Queyranne</a>. Before joining UBC Sauder I was an associate professor of operations management at the <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a> <a href="http://www.chicagobooth.edu"> Booth School of Business </a>. <br><br>

My research interests are in the theory of optimization (including infinite-dimensional, discrete, and stochastic) with applications to theoretical economics (contract theory, game theory, and mechanism design), operations management, and decision problems in the digital economy (particularly video games and apps) <br>

<br>

ezza: Empowering Women through Nails (with Kim Marsh and Lindsey Joseph) <br>
<br>
<em>Ale and Kim have started a chain of nail salons based around the idea of "empowering women on both sides of the manicure table". Their disruptive approach --- including extended operating hours, online appointment booking, and salaried employees --- aims to transform the nail industry. But can they prove their operating model to investors, or do they need to adjust their vision?</em><br>
<br>

Kumwe Harvest: Social enterprise in Rwanda (with Cyril Khamsi and Alex Sanderson)<br>
<br>
<em>Cyril took a bold move after graduating from MIT to start a new logistics company in Rwanda. But that was just the beginning. This case explores how Cyril got drawn into the maize business and stumbled across a new way to harvest grain in rural Rwanda. But will this disruptive approach to maize supply chain be sustainable, given the power of other players in the market and their reliance on a single large buyer?  </em><br>
<br>

Advocate Children’s Sleep Network (with Darius Loghmanee, Matthew Balog, and Noah Hamilton)<br>
<br>
<em>Darius has taken a bold approach to decentralizing services for pediatric sleep medicine, matching patients with the right level of care by educating a wider base of health care providers about sleep health. In the process, Darius freed up his time to focus on the most challenging cases that require his expertise. But will the gamble be able to navigate a health care system transitioning from fee-for-service to value-based care?    </em><br>

<strong>Book projects</strong><br><br>
<em>These books are all in different stages of development. Please contact me if they interest you and I can share additional details. The hope is to get them written as soon as possible. Posting about them here is a commitment strategy for me!</em><br>
<br>

Paths to research: A companion to research as a career  (with <a href="https://runshanfu.com/"> Runshan Fu</a> and illustrations by Mengzhenyu Zhang) <br>
<br>
<em>This book tackles the challenge of navigating a career in academic research. It is the culmination of many discussions with students over 7+ years of offering a workshop called "The Art of Research'' to groups of students in Canada, the United States, and China. The intended audience is undergraduate students considering a career in academic research, current PhD students, and young faculty. The book can be studied individually and in groups. The authors (Runshan and Chris) hope to offer workshops based on the book in a variety of settings to help aspiring researchers on their journey towards success as academics. </em><br>
<br>
An invitation to infinite dimensional linear programming <br>
<br>
<em>This book is in development based on course notes from offerings on infinite dimensional linear programming at the University of Chicago and UBC, with workshops on related topics at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics and the Chinese Academy of Science. The target audience of the book is graduate students in operations research, computer science, and economics with no previous exposure to functional analysis and measure theory but only courses in real analysis, linear algebra, and convex or linear optimization.</em><br>
<br>
Operating values: A journey through operations management  (with Hariharan Mahadevan) <br>
<br>
<em>This book captures insights and learnings from over 10 years of teaching operations management classes to MBA students at the University of Chicago and UBC. I hope to cover the main topics a student might come across in a "core operations management" class, adding historical, social, and philosophical context. The title "Operating values" talks about how our values and worldview can shape our design of operations, and conversely, how values and worldviews are implicitly communicated by the design of operations with interact with. The target audience is students of operations management at the master's level, as well as operations management instructors interested in a fresh take on the topic.</em><br>
