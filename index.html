I'm an associate professor in the Operations and Logistics division in the <a href="http://www.sauder.ubc.ca"> UBC Sauder School of Business</a> at the <a href="http://www.ubc.ca">University of British Columbia</a>. I obtained my PhD in Management Science at the <a href="http://www.sauder.ubc.ca">UBC Sauder School of Business</a>, advised by <a href="http://www.sauder.ubc.ca/Faculty/People/Faculty_Members/Queyranne_Maurice">Maurice Queyranne</a>. Before joining UBC Sauder I was an associate professor of operations management at the <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a> <a href="http://www.chicagobooth.edu"> Booth School of Business</a>. <br><br>

Until recently, most of my research was in optimization theory, game theory, theoretical economics, operations management, and video game design. My emerging areas of interest are: operations of education and development, small business operations, the history and philosophy of the science of management, and pedagogy for business education, including K-12. I also enjoy writing books and cases for teaching.<br>

<strong>Book projects</strong><br><br>

Writing books has become more and more of a focus of mine in recent years. I have listed some projects here as a kind of commitment mechanism. I hope I will be able to complete many of these books without too much delay. Fingers crossed.
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://christopher-thomas-ryan.github.io/papers/Paths_to_Research.pdf">Paths to research: A companion to research as a career</a> (with <a href="https://runshanfu.com/">Runshan Fu</a> and illustrations by <a href="https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/personal-website-zhenyu">Mengzhenyu Zhang</a>) <br>
<br>
<em>This book tackles the challenge of navigating a career in academic research. It is the culmination of many discussions with students over 7+ years of offering a workshop called "The Art of Research'' to groups of students in Canada, the United States, and China. The intended audience is undergraduate students considering a career in academic research, current PhD students, and young faculty. The book can be studied individually and in groups. The authors (Runshan and Chris) hope to offer workshops based on the book in a variety of settings to help aspiring researchers on their journey towards success as academics. A draft of the completed book is available upon request and is currently under review at UBC Press. </em><br>

<br>
Operations management: Balancing design and devotion (with Nanxi Zhang) <br>
<br>
<em>A textbook project for MBA teaching of operations management that embraces the "human" side of managing operations. It is based on 15 years of teaching "core" operations management and service operations to MBAs at the University of Chicago and the University of British Columbia. It will capture the main lessons I have taken away from what resonates with MBA students on fundamental subjects connected to operations management. The title of the book is inspired by the 1992 classic paper of Barley and Kunda, "Design and devotion: Surges of rational and normative ideologies of control in managerial discourse" that provides a common rhetorical and historical framework for organization theory, operations management, management science, and organizational behavior. The embrace of "human factors" is reminiscent of pioneering textbooks in operations management, including ``Modern production management: managing the operations function'' (1st ed.) by Elwood Buffa originally released in 1961. 
<br>
<br>
The book is currently a series of essays with a plan to incorporate them into a coherent text. If you are interested in learning more about this project, please contact me. </em><br>

The reluctant teacher: A companion for researchers who also must teach
<br>
<br>
<em>
This book aims to take on the challenge of teaching by those hired primarily to excel in research, a common situation for many faculty at research-focused universities. The book tackles challenges such as balancing research and teaching, leverage research in teaching (and vice versa), and minimizing effort and stress associated with teaching. It also takes a fresh approach to traditional teaching subjects such as motivating students, preparing lectures, facilitating class discussions, etc. The book is based on teaching a course on business school teaching for PhD students at the Sauder School of Business and 15 years of teaching experiences at universities.

The book is currently a series of essays with a plan to incorporate them into a coherent text. If you are interested in learning more about this project, please contact me.

Reversed perspectives: My love-fear relationship with mathematics
<br>
<br>
<em>
This book is a mix of philosophy, confessional, biography, and book of advice about my turbelent relationship with mathematics from childhood to the present day. I hope the book will be of benefit to those with an uneasy connection to mathematics, who lack confidence in their mathematical skills, have felt judged for their lack of mathematical creativity, or are seeking to help students dealing with such challenges.

Questions first: Reflections on years of awkward conversation
<br>
<br>
<em>
This book chronicles my experiences and reflections on facilitating conversations over the last 20+ years. There are two main sources of experiences for the book. The first is hosting conversations at "English Corner", a conversation English class I have volunteered to host for over 20 years. The second is facilitating discussions in MBA classrooms, which I have done for 8+ years. I hope the book will be of benefit to aspiring group facilitators, discussion leaders, managers, and instructors interested in introducing more discussion in their classrooms.
